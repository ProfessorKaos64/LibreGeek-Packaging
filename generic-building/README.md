# Generic building scripts

* `backport-debian-pkg.sh` - One of the main scripts that see's the most usage. Backport Debian or Ubuntu packages with only a URL to the DSC file.
* `build-deb-from-ppa.sh` - Not used as much, aimed at backporting from Ubuntu PPA sources directly.
* `build-deb-from-src.sh` - Tries to build a simple, non-traditional Debian package using checkinstall.
* `convert-npm-package.sh` - Convert NPM packages to Debian-style packages
* `downloadpackages.sh` - Download packages from a repo pool
