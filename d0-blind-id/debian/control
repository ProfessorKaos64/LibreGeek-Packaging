Description: library for user identification using RSA blind signatures
 d0_blind_id is an implementation of RSA "blind signatures",
 Diffie-Hellmann key exchange and Schnorr identification. It can be used
 by the DarkPlaces game engine (as used in Xonotic) to perform anonymous
 registration with a central server, providing cryptographic identities
 which are used in Xonotic for access control on individual game servers.
 .
 This implementation has not been audited independently, and is not
 currently recommended for non-game uses.
