Description: Libretro wrapper for the Beetle PSX core
 This wrapper makes Beetle PSX core API compatible with libretro, thus
 allowing its use with libretro frontends, such as RetroArch.
 .
 Beetle is a fork of Mednafen for libretro. This core emulates the PlayStation
 console.
 .
 It also provides the new Mednafen/Beetle PSX HW core, which includes an OpenGL
 renderer backend.
