 This C source file is part of the SoftFloat IEC/IEEE Floating-point Arithmetic
 Package, Release 2b.
 .
 Written by John R. Hauser.  This work was made possible in part by the
 International Computer Science Institute, located at Suite 600, 1947 Center
 Street, Berkeley, California 94704.  Funding was partially provided by the

 of this code was written as part of a project to build a fixed-point vector
 processor in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley,
 overseen by Profs. Nelson Morgan and John Wawrzynek.  More information
 is available through the Web page `http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jhauser/
