Comment:
 Clarification of the sources of shipped binaries:
  Data/Sys/GC/dsp_*
   These are the binaries for dolphin's DSP replacement ROM.
   Information about them can be found in docs/DSP/free_dsp_rom.
  Data/Sys/Wii/*
   This directory contains template Wii configuration files (the main SYSCONF
   and Wii Connect 24 files). The SYSCONF file can be generated by dolphin-emu.
   The wc24 files have no source as such, but the format of these files are
   known.
  Data/Sys/totaldb.dsy
   Contains various function symbols found in games used by dolphin's internal
   debugger. This file format can be read / generated from within dolphin-emu
   (but the data itself took some time to find).
